## 1. Introduction.
<img src="reason.png" height="110"> 
Reason, also known as ReasonML, is a syntax extension and toolchain for OCaml created by Jordan Walke at Facebook. Reason offers a syntax familiar to JavaScript programmers, and transpiles to OCaml. Statically typed Reason (or OCaml) code may be compiled to dynamically typed JavaScript using the BuckleScript compiler.
<br /><br />
The Reason community officially provides ReasonReact as a solution for React based web applications
